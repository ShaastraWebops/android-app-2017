    <string name="summit_main_para1">This year’s Summit strives to bring about a change in society by addressing an issue that is taken for granted by most people: <b>Accessibility.</b></string>
    <string name="summit_main_para2">Climbing stairs, listening to a lecture, reading a billboard, expressing dissent are some activities that most of us tend to perform quite effortlessly. Turning a “blind eye” to a “lame joke” is something that comes naturally to a lot of us. We crib to no end when people refuse to talk to us in a language we understand because it makes us feel like an outsider.</string>
    <string name="summit_main_para3">If there is one thing that human beings hate, it is the feeling of being excluded or pitied upon, as this is a constant reminder of what one cannot do.</string>
    <string name="summit_main_para4">Accessibility is an attempt to get rid of this exclusion in various important spheres – physical environments, public spaces, the digital realm, education, employment, technology, transport. It is concerned with the removal of barriers, to set the record straight on what causes a disability: not an individual’s inability to do something but the society’s tendency to throw unnecessary obstacles. Accessibility is a spectrum - it means usability, it means removing limitations and tapping opportunities.</string>
    <string name="summit_main_para5">The <b>International Accessibility Summit of Shaastra 2017</b>, IIT Madras, a 4 day-long event to be held between <b>31st December, 2016 to 3rd January, 2017</b>, is a platform for multiple stakeholders in the field of Accessibility and Assistive Technology to come together and share their knowledge. It is a chance for students from various fields of study to meet and ideate on how to make India truly accessible.</string>
    <string name="summit_events_para1"><b>Case Study Competition:</b> The Case Study Competition aims to bring to focus the obstacles with regard to Accessibility in India. Participants will get the opportunity to work on problem statements provided by professional organizations tailored from real-life challenges. They will be required to work in groups with students from different backgrounds. The objective is to analyze the problem, discuss existent models, and present a workable solution.</string>
    <string name="summit_events_para2"><b>Social Enterprise Competition:</b> This event is targeted towards students interested in entrepreneurship in the social sector.It will be a chance for innovative individuals to devise a profitable and practical business model intended to improve accessibility in terms of technology, service delivery, legal aid etc., and find methods to implement it. </string>
    <string name="summit_events_para3"><b>Hackathon for the Visually Impaired:</b> This is a platform for visually impaired students to demonstrate their proficiency in computer science and programming. It aims to bring to focus the immense potential for employability and independence that people with disabilities have but is often ignored. To bring out the best in the participants,International Accessibility Summit has collaborated with Vision-Aid to teach visually impaired students the basics of programming. For this, students from IIT Madras have volunteered to act as teaching assistants.</string>
    <string name="summit_events_para4"><b>Central Panel Discussion:</b> The Summit will host a panel comprised of experts working in different ways to make the country more accessible. The panelists are from varied fields - policy making, assistive technology, corporate social responsibility, and the social sector. The discussion will bring to light the world standards for inclusivity and how India can match up to them.</string>
    <string name="summit_events_para5"><b>Lectures and Workshops:</b> Participants will be exposed to different aspects of the theme of Accessibility through lectures covering topics of policy development and assistive technology. The participants will also take part in a Sensitization workshop to break the social stigma against disability and provide an in-depth understanding of the topic of inclusion and accessibility.They will also take part in a Web Accessibility workshop to understand accessibility of Information technology.</string>
