    <string name="summit_main_para1">This year’s Summit strives to bring about a change in society by addressing an issue that is taken for granted by most people: <b>Accessibility.</b></string>
    <string name="summit_main_para2">Climbing stairs, listening to a lecture, reading a billboard, expressing dissent are some activities that most of us tend to perform quite effortlessly. Turning a “blind eye” to a “lame joke” is something that comes naturally to a lot of us. We crib to no end when people refuse to talk to us in a language we understand because it makes us feel like an outsider.</string>
    <string name="summit_main_para3">If there is one thing that human beings hate, it is the feeling of being excluded or pitied upon, as this is a constant reminder of what one cannot do.</string>
    <string name="summit_main_para4">Accessibility is an attempt to get rid of this exclusion in various important spheres – physical environments, public spaces, the digital realm, education, employment, technology, transport. It is concerned with the removal of barriers, to set the record straight on what causes a disability: not an individual’s inability to do something but the society’s tendency to throw unnecessary obstacles. Accessibility is a spectrum - it means usability, it means removing limitations and tapping opportunities.</string>
    <string name="summit_main_para5">The <b>International Accessibility Summit of Shaastra 2017</b>, IIT Madras, a 4 day-long event to be held between <b>31st December, 2016 to 3rd January, 2017</b>, is a platform for multiple stakeholders in the field of Accessibility and Assistive Technology to come together and share their knowledge.

It aims to bring to focus the immense potential for employability and independence that people with disabilities have but is often ignored. To bring out the best in the participants,International Accessibility Summit has collaborated with Vision-Aid to teach visually impaired students the basics of programming. For this, students from IIT Madras have volunteered to act as teaching assistants.</string>
    <string name="summit_events_para4"><b>Central Panel Discussion:</b> The Summit will host a panel comprised of experts working in different ways to make the country more accessible. The panelists are from varied fields - policy making, assistive technology, corporate social responsibility, and the social sector.
